# Working with deps


## Intro

The project uses rebar to manage dependencies with help of
[rebar plugins](https://github.com/EchoTeam/rebar-plugins).

When you just clone the repository of the project, you need to `make get-deps`
first to download all deps. Some make targets do it on their own though.


## rebar.config.lock

`rebar.config.lock` helps to create reproducible builds for the project.
It is generated by rebar-lock-deps plugin. The file lists every dependency
of the project and locks it at a specific git revision (see more info on
[the plugin page](https://github.com/EchoTeam/rebar-lock-deps)).

When you change the `deps` section in any `rebar.config` file (the root one or of a dep),
you will need to update `rebar.config.lock` file. You can run
`make update-lock` to update the lock for all deps or
`make update-lock apps=app1,app2` to update it for specific deps.

See more in [make update-lock](service_MAKE.md#make-update-lock).
